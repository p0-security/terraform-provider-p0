# p0_mysql_staged (Resource)

A staged MySQL installation. Staged resources generate the infrastructure configuration needed to deploy P0's MySQL connector.

**Important:** If using RDS hosting, you must first install the p0_aws_rds resource for the instance's VPC.

Use the read-only attributes defined on this resource to get the shell commands or Terraform configuration needed to create the P0 connector infrastructure.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Stage the MySQL installation
resource "p0_mysql_staged" "example" {
  id = "my-mysql-instance"
  hosting = {
    type         = "aws-rds"
    instance_arn = "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:db:my-mysql-instance"
    vpc_id       = "vpc-0123456789abcdef0"
  }
}

# Deploy Lambda connector infrastructure
# (Lambda function, IAM roles, VPC endpoints, etc.)

# Complete the installation
resource "p0_mysql" "example" {
  id         = p0_mysql_staged.example.id
  default_db = "demo-db"
  depends_on = [aws_lambda_function.mysql_connector]
}
```
