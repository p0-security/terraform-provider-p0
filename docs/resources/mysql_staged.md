# p0_mysql_staged (Resource)

A staged MySQL installation for AWS RDS. Staged resources generate the infrastructure configuration needed to deploy the Lambda connector for MySQL database access management.

**Important:** Before using this resource, you must first install the `p0_aws_rds` resource for the VPC.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Stage the MySQL installation
resource "p0_mysql_staged" "example" {
  id           = "my-mysql-instance"
  instance_arn = "arn:aws:rds:us-east-1:123456789012:db:my-mysql-instance"
  vpc_id       = "vpc-0123456789abcdef0"
}

# Deploy Lambda connector infrastructure
# (Lambda function, IAM roles, VPC endpoints, etc.)

# Complete the installation
resource "p0_mysql" "example" {
  id           = p0_mysql_staged.example.id
  instance_arn = p0_mysql_staged.example.instance_arn
  vpc_id       = p0_mysql_staged.example.vpc_id
  depends_on   = [aws_lambda_function.mysql_connector]
}
```
