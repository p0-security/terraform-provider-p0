# p0_routing_rules (Resource)

The rules that control who can request access to what, and access requirements.
See [the P0 request-routing docs](https://docs.p0.dev/just-in-time-access/request-routing).

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "p0_routing_rules" "example" {
  rule {
    requestor = {
      type      = "group"
      directory = "okta"
      id        = "00abcdefghijklmno697"
      label     = "AWS Developers"
    }
    resource = {
      type    = "integration"
      service = "aws"
      filters = {
        "tag" = {
          effect  = "keep"
          key     = "p0_grantable"
          pattern = "1|true"
        }
      }
    }
    approval {
      type        = "auto"
      integration = "pagerduty"

## Schema

### Optional

- `rule` (Block Set) All access rules (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rule))

<a id="nestedblock--rule"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rule`

Required:

- `name` (String) The name of the rule
- `requestor` (Attributes) Controls who has access. See [the Requestor docs](https://docs.p0.dev/just-in-time-access/request-routing#requestor). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rule--requestor))
- `resource` (Attributes) Controls what is accessed. See [the Resource docs](https://docs.p0.dev/just-in-time-access/request-routing#resource). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rule--resource))

Optional:

- `approval` (Block List) Determines access requirements. See [the Approval docs](https://docs.p0.dev/just-in-time-access/request-routing#approval). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rule--approval))

<a id="nestedatt--rule--requestor"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rule.requestor`

- 'any': Any requestor will match
- 'group': Members of a directory group will match
- 'user': Only match a single user

Optional:

- `directory` (String) May only be used if 'type' is 'group'. One of "azure-ad", "okta", or "workspace".
- `id` (String) May only be used if 'type' is 'group'. This is the directory's internal group identifier for matching requestors.

### Nested Schema for `rule.resource`

Required:

- `type` (String) How P0 matches resources:
- 'any': Any resource
- 'integration': Only resources within a specified integration

Optional:

- `filters` (Attributes Map) May only be used if 'type' is 'integration'. Available filters depend on the value of 'service'.
See [the Resource docs](https://docs.p0.dev/just-in-time-access/request-routing#resource) for a list of available filters. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--rule--resource--filters))
- `service` (String) May only be used if 'type' is 'integration'.
